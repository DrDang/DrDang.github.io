## The Challenge
Our manual firmware and software loading process for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) was time-consuming, error-prone, and required an entire day per unit. Technicians had to individually process each Shop Replaceable Unit (SRU) using unique procedures, which introduced inefficiencies and the risk of human error.

    </div>

## The Solution
I designed and developed a fully autonomous system that transformed this process into a streamlined, error-proof operation. By leveraging automated test equipment (ATE) and custom hardware interfaces, I enabled the firmware and software for all SRUs to be loaded and audited directly at the LRU level. This eliminated the need to disassemble LRUs and process SRUs individually.

Key technical innovations included:
- Custom cable modifications to access all necessary interfaces at once.
- Multithreaded software to concurrently configure and load SRUs.
- A robust logging and reporting system to ensure traceability and quality assurance.

    </div>

    The new system involved keeping all SRUs in the LRU and interfacing via a couple of cables.

## The Impact
This solution reduced the loading and audit process from 8 hours to just 1.5 hours—a 266% improvement in efficiency—while eliminating human error and ensuring consistent quality. The system has become a cornerstone of production, significantly increasing throughput and reliability.

Due to the proprietary nature of this work, I am unable to share detailed specifics. However, the high-level insights provided here demonstrate the transformative impact of this automation on productivity and operational excellence.
