## The Challenge
Our production floor relied on 20 test stations, which were often in varying states—engineering development, production-ready, or down for repair or calibration. Unfortunately, production runs frequently occurred on stations that weren’t fully operational, leading to failed tests, wasted efficiency, and unnecessary product wear.

## The Solution
To address this, I designed and implemented a scalable software solution for visual management. This system enabled clear communication about each station’s status and configuration, reducing errors and improving coordination across teams.

### How It Works
Only engineers could mark a station as “ready” (green), with a desktop label showing the current configuration. However, anyone could mark a station as “down” (red), adding a reason for its status. This information was displayed prominently to communicate issues across shifts and departments.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/stationDown.jpg" title="stationDown" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/stationUp.jpg" title="stationUp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A red desktop easily conveys that the test equipment is down.
</div>

## The Impact
This simple yet effective solution eliminated non-compliant test runs, improved coordination between engineers and technicians, and minimized production delays. It became a valuable tool for maintaining efficiency on the floor.
