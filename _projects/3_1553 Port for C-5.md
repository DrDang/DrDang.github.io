I successfully ported a wrapper originally developed for a Condor 1553 VXI card in a systems integration lab to support a newer 1553 VXI card from Abaco, all written in C. This ensured seamless compatibility with legacy higher-level test scripts, preserving their functionality and enabling continued testing of a Honeywell product for the C-5 platform.
