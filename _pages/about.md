I’m an electrical, test, and systems engineer passionate about learning and creating meaningful impact through technology! My fascination with engineering began as a child, captivated by how those little green cities on rectangles—circuit boards—power the miraculous world around us.

Over time, resilience, dedication, and curiosity have become my guiding principles, shaping both my work and life. Here are some of my favorite stories of grit and perseverance:

- Achieving a Dream: At 16, I dreamed of attending high school in Japan. After researching exchange programs, my first application was rejected. Undeterred, I improved my application and succeeded the following year, achieving my goal in 2009. Now, I’m fluent in Japanese, holding a JLPT N2 certification

- Accelerating Through College: I entered an electrical engineering program that required completing Calculus II by sophomore year to stay on track for a 4-year degree. Starting behind in math with only precalculus, I self-studied, tested out of trigonometry, and completed Calculus II over the summer. By taking full summer courses and consistently overloading with 18+ credits, I graduated on time from a typically 5-year program.

- Earning My PE: In 2023, I set out to earn my Professional Engineer (PE) certification. Over the course of a year, I passed both the FE and PE exams on my first attempts, despite the PE being offered only once annually.

- Becoming CCNA Certified: While studying for my PE, I recognized the importance of networking in my work. I studied for and passed the Cisco CCNA exam on my first attempt, earning certification as a Cisco Certified Networking Associate.

- Pioneering Research: As a college freshman, I led a research submission for the inaugural New Mexico Tech Student Research Symposium. After the application was rejected for format issues, I spent the entire night redoing the paper and presentation. The next day, I resubmitted successfully and presented our research.

- Improving Relationships: In 2017, I committed to improving my personal relationships. By researching and working with dating coaches, I transformed my social skills and built meaningful connections—ultimately leading to my marriage.

- Leading Advanced Projects: In just eight years, I progressed from Engineer 1 to Lead Systems Engineer, guiding development on one of Honeywell’s most complex military avionics systems—the F-15 Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II).
