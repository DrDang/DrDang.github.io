I’m an electrical, test, and systems engineer passionate about learning and creating meaningful impact through technology! I am professionally licensed as a Professional Engineer (PE) and qualified to contribute to sensitive and regulated projects. My fascination with engineering began as a child, captivated by how those little green cities on rectangles—circuit boards—power the miraculous world around us.

*P.S. - Despite the “Dr” in my username, I don’t hold a doctorate. It was a college nickname that stuck!*

Over time, resilience, dedication, and curiosity have become my guiding principles, shaping both my work and life. Here are some of my favorite stories of grit and perseverance:

### Achieving a Dream
At 16, I dreamed of attending high school in Japan. After researching exchange programs, my first application was rejected. Undeterred, I improved my application and succeeded the following year, achieving my goal in 2009. Now, I’m proficient in Japanese, holding a JLPT N2 certification.

### Accelerating Through College
I entered an electrical engineering program that required completing Calculus II by sophomore year to stay on track for a 4-year degree. Starting behind in math with only pre-calculus, I self-studied, tested out of trigonometry, and completed Calculus II over the summer. By taking full summer courses and consistently overloading with 18+ credits, I graduated on time from a typically 5-year program.

### Earning My PE
In 2023, I set out to earn my Professional Engineer (PE) certification. Over the course of a year, I passed both the FE and PE exams on my first attempts, despite the PE being offered only once annually.

### Becoming CCNA Certified
While studying for my PE, I recognized the importance of networking in my work. I studied for and passed the Cisco CCNA exam on my first attempt, earning certification as a Cisco Certified Networking Associate.

### Leading Advanced Projects
In just eight years, I progressed from Engineer 1 to Lead Systems Engineer, guiding development on one of Honeywell’s most complex military avionics systems—the F-15 Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II). Now I'm working on the new upcoming Honeywell 360 Display system!
